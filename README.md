# pytorch-VGG-Model

training a pretrained ImageNet VGG-19 model on CIFAR10:
adding data augmentation on the dataset,
using ADAM as the gradient optimizer
and adding L2 regularization 

the purpose of this repository is to use this trained model on a different dataset in the near future.

# Prerequisites
